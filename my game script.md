Hi if you see this text, welcome to my all-new project of creating an open world demolition derby game using Unreal engine 5 !
This game should be called "wrecking world : the car demoliton game"
I want every person who goes here to show me a version of the project which is ruled like thi :
- open world (obviously)
- many cars "fictionalized"
- visual and performance damage
- many places from real world "fictionalized"
- big game area for each venue (32x32 or 64x64 kmÂ²)
- frequent updates (each month) max 2 months !
- regular events (pikes peak, dakar, le mans and so on)
- different road surfaces
- changing conditions
- custom cars and places
- and so on...
if you want to add more please mail me at arno64160@gmail.com
